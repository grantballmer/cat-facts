# Cat Facts Application

A live demo of the site is available here: [Cat Facs](https://grantballmer.github.io/cat-facts/#/).

## How to clone and run repository

Navigate to your projects directory, then you can run:

### `git clone https://github.com/grantballmer/cat-facts.git`

The repository will be downloading into a 'cats-facts' directory.
Navigate to that directory by running:

### `cd cat-facts`

Next you will need to install all the packages using npm

### `npm install`

Once the packages have installed successfully you can get a local development site by running the following command:

### `npm run start`

You will see a message in your terminal 'Starting the development server...', and then once everything is compiled a 'Compiled Successfully' message.
At that point you can then view it in the browser here: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
